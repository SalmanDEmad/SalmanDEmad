# SalmanDEmad's GitHub Profile

Hello, I'm SalmanDEmad! I'm passionate about web development, software development, and automation. I'm also an active YouTuber, creating content on a variety of tech-related topics.

## About Me
I'm a self-taught developer with a strong interest in building web applications and automating processes. I enjoy tinkering with new technologies and finding ways to make development more efficient and enjoyable.

When I'm not coding, you can find me creating videos for my YouTube channel, [@sigmaspirits](https://www.youtube.com/sigmaspirits). I cover a range of topics, including personal growth philosophy, tech industry and make mini documentaries about stuffs that matter.

## Projects
Here are some of my recent projects:

1. **Artist Portfolio Website:**
   A project for artists if they want a standalone website for portfolio and to interact with clients with dedicated domain. 

2. **Social Media Website:**
   Alternative to mainstream social media platforms where you are controlled and manipulated by algorithms. In this platform, you don't have a feed by default and you need to customise how you want the feed to be. Also with some cool "time capsule" features. If interested in helping, contact below.

3. **LifeLines Hackathon - Media and Awareness (Semantic Analysis and Fact Questioning):**
   Ordinarily, anti-msm startups do sentiment analysis to designate articles to different parts of political spectrum. To add to this, there are a large number of startups popping up trying to "fact check" news source with the use of AI. Both are unfeasible and unproductive solutions. Sentiment analysis seeks to fix a problem we don't have. Fact checking is far too inefficient and prone to bias and hallucinations for the purpose of fact checking.

   Hence, this project proposes alternatives in the forms of semantic analysis and fact questioning, as opposed to sentiment analysis and fact checking. What semantic analysis aims to do is expose dubious undertones and lingual gymnastics to obscurify an event. Meanwhile, fact questioning is proposed as an alternative to fact checking as AI cannot come up with poisoned hallucinations as questions don't really need any sort of checkings or verifications resulting in zero hallucinations. This project was originally for hackathon at Carnegie Mellon University - Qatar.
